## Introduction

> [!CAUTION]
> **Neu**tomic is currently in early development and is not yet ready for production use. Please check back later for updates.

Neutomic is a fast, asynchronous, lightweight PHP framework tailored for long-running process environments.

Key components of Neutomic include:

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Built on top of [revolt-php](https://revolt.run/), Neu supports event-driven, non-blocking I/O operations, ensuring efficient handling of concurrent tasks.
- **Non-Blocking HTTP Server**: It leverages [amphp/http-server](https://amphp.org/http-server), a non-blocking HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 server, enabling fast, scalable web applications.

Neu is designed to power high-traffic APIs, complex web applications, and real-time data processing systems. By adopting modern asynchronous PHP features, Neu helps developers build robust, efficient applications that are well-suited to today's dynamic, high-load environments.

## Demo

Look at the demo repository [neutomic/demo](https://github.com/neutomic/demo) for a simple example of a Neu application.
