     * or further processed by a handler which is resolved using the HandlerResolverInterface.

     * - `RequestEvent`: Triggered before the request is processed by a handler.
     * - `HandlerEvent`: Triggered when a handler is about to process the request.
     * - Any exceptions that occur during handling are managed by dispatching `ExceptionEvent`.

     * is passed through a response event for potential modifications before being returned.
